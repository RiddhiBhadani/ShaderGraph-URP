# ShaderGraph-URP
 ShaderGraph with the Universal Render Pipeline(URP) in Unity

**Overview**

This Unity project demonstrates the capabilities of the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) in conjunction with ShaderGraph. It includes various custom effects such as base color manipulation, texture and UV mapping, transparency and alpha handling, depth buffer utilization, dither effects, vertex shader implementations, and basic lighting techniques.

You can navigate to **Asset->Shaders** to explore shader graphs's visual scripting and can also check its materials, **Asset->Materials**.

Refer Scene  - **Main** to see visual effects.

It's still in progress..!
Have a Fun creating shader graphs!
